# Implement a support vector machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs from the Kaggle dataset.

This project demonstrates how to perform image classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM) in Python. The dataset consists of images stored in subdirectories representing different classes. The images are preprocessed, and an SVM model is trained to classify them.

## Requirements:
1. numpy
2. opencv-python
3. scikit-learn
4. matplotlib

## Dataset Structure:
